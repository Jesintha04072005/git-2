  <p><b>The morning sun painted the sky</b><strong> in shades of gold and orange,</strong><i> as the cool breeze gently</i><em> moved through the trees.</em> <sub>Birds sang cheerfully,</sub>
    <sup> welcoming the new day with the</sup><mark>sweet melodies. The world felt fresh and calm,</mark>
     <ins>reminding everyone that each day</ins><del>is a new beginning 
      filled with endless</del><small> possibilities</small></p>
  <hr>
  <h3 style="color:red"><pre>When night has sung its final song,
The sky begins to blush along,
A golden thread through shadows weaves,
Awakening earth, the restless leaves.

The gentle breeze, a tender call,
Spreads light and hope across it all,
Each day a gift, so soft, so new—
The world begins its dance for you.</h3>
